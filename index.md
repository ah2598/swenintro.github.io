## SWEN 101 Github IO Introduction

### [About Me]
Hello, my name's Andy He and I'm a student of RIT. For high school I went to cardozo high school but my grades didn't stand out with only a 93. Luckily, my SAT score of 1500 carried me. I'm a very curious person so as expected, I have a lot of hobbies, making me a jack of all trades. However, these hobbies weren't just one month hobbies because I did seriously practice my hobbies beyond the bare basics. Just to list a few: lockpicking, coding, piano, art, parkour, modeling (animations) and a lot of things I've probably forgotten. I came from the big city (NYC) but as I've lived there my whole life, it's hard to comment on what's special about it. Though I will say Manhattan is definitely what I'd mention since that's what comes to mind when I think "big city" and probaly for others too. Queens is the borough I lived in and every borough feels normal compared to Manhattan.
